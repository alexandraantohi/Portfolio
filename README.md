# Portfolio
In this repository I have Portfolio Projects

1.Chore Door : is a single-page website that plays a fully-functional game. You will see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact harmoniously to produce a dynamic website.

2.Musicon is a website of an online musical instruments store. I incorporate HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website.

3.Ravenous project is a React app to search for restaurants using Yelp API
